# üñäÔ∏è Hand-written Digits Recognition

**Team size:** 4 people  
**Project Field:** Computer Vision, Image Processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification Problem  

This project explores **handwritten digit classification** using both **CNN** and **KNN** approaches. It evaluates performance on both the MNIST dataset and human-generated input from a custom GUI drawing tool. Experiments include varying distance metrics, Gaussian filtering, dropout rates, and model size to analyze their effect on accuracy.  

A **pre-trained CNN model** is provided (`final_model.h5`) for real-time digit prediction, while additional experiments on KNN and KNN with Gaussian constraints are documented in Kaggle notebooks.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### üñ•Ô∏è Main Application
- **`main.py`**  
  - GUI for drawing digits using `tkinter`.  
  - Predicts digits using **CNN** (`final_model.h5`).  
  - **Preprocessing steps:**  
    1. Crop the digit from the canvas.  
    2. Resize while preserving aspect ratio to 28√ó28.  
    3. Center the digit in a 28√ó28 image.  
    4. Normalize pixel values to [0, 1].  

### üõ†Ô∏è Utilities
- **`ultility/drawer.py`** ‚Äì Draw digits and save as **28√ó28 grayscale images** in CSV.  
- **`ultility/show.py`** ‚Äì Display human-drawn digits from `digit_data1.csv`.  
- **`ultility/showMNIST.py`** ‚Äì Visualize MNIST dataset digits.  

### üíæ Data & Models
- **`digit_data1.csv`** ‚Äì Human-generated digit dataset (cropped, resized, centered, flattened, labeled).  
- **`final_model.h5`** ‚Äì Pre-trained CNN model for digit recognition. Trained on MNIST and augmented with human-drawn digits.

## ‚ö° How to Run

> ‚ö†Ô∏è TensorFlow does not support Python 3.13. Use Python 3.11 or 3.12.

1. **Create a virtual environment (Python 3.11 recommended):**  
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   * *Windows:*
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   * *Linux/Mac:*
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r req.txt
   ```

4. **Run the main application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Save custom digits using the drawer utility:**
   ```bash
   python ultility/drawer.py
   ```

6. **Visualize datasets:**
   ```bash
   python ultility/show.py       # For human-drawn digits
   python ultility/showMNIST.py  # For MNIST digits
   ```

## üìå Notes

* **Prediction Accuracy:** The CNN is robust to human input but may occasionally misclassify ambiguous strokes. Preprocessing ensures the drawn digit is centered and scaled consistently.

* **Evaluation:** KNN experiments analyze differences between distance-based and deep learning-based classification. This highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach for real-world input.
